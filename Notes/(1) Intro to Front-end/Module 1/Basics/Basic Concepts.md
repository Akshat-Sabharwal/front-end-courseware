These are some of the fundamentals not **specific** to front-end development, only, rather every aspect of life.
### Framework
A well-structured plan or tool to execute an action of a specific category is a **framework**. For instance, in order to crack an egg, the steps to follow are,

- Pick up the egg
- Strike it, gently, with a hard surface
- Crack it open with ease

This is the * **framework** to crack an egg*.
### Library 
A framework is a methodical way of completing a task. A **library** is built in a way that makes it easy to work with the framework. 

For instance, instead of cracking the egg with bare hands, use an egg-cracker. Here, the device acts as a **library**.

### API
Standing for **Application Programming Interface**, it is a medium to access and use databases and servers from **client-side**.

##### Examples
Here are some of the APIs and their functions.

| API          | Function                                 |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Browser      | Interpret JavaScript code in the browser |
| RESTful      | Access data from server or database      |
| Sensor-Based | Communicate with sensors (IoT)           |
