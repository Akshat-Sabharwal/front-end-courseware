A service provided by owners of large data centers wherein specific memory and computational power is allocated to the client to **host** or bring a website online.

### Types

* #### Shared Hosting
	The bandwidth and memory of a physical server is shared with other users and thus, the user with higher power and memory demand would use the majority of it.

* #### Virtual Private Hosting 
	The memory and power supply is pre-determined and remains constant regardless of the demand.

* #### Dedicated Hosting
	A full-fledged physical server is allocated to the user which, too, has upper bounds on memory and power usage but a lot more higher than VPS.

* #### Cloud Hosting
	Both physical server and a cloud server is solely dedicated  to a single user with extreme power and memory.
