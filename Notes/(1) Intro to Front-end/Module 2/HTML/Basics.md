**HTML** stands for **Hypertext Markup Language**.

Hypertext → Link to other texts
Markup → Content of the document (Tags and Elements)

### Syntax
Set of rules to abide while writing code in a certain programming language. **Semantics** refers to how coherent the code is.

#### Element
The building blocks of an HTML document or structure are regarded as **elements**. Just as a paragraph of a blog post or a component of a mobile phone.

```html
<p> A paragraph </p>
```

#### Tags
In HTML, **tags** denote an **element** in a code. Tags often contain what’s called **attribute** which provides more information about the **element** and how it should be structured in the document.

```html
<element> is the opening tag of the element
</element> is the closing tag of the element

<element attribute="description"> denotes the provision of an attribute and associated value
```


>Note → The value of an attribute need not be enclosed in double or single quotes.
