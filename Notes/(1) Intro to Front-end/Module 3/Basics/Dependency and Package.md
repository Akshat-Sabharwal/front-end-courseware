We have already discussed about **libraries and frameworks** in Module 1.

## Dependencies
Using reusable and pre-built functions in code is an efficient practice. 
If our code doesn't include the **dependencies** used, it will not respond to the API and get an error. 
Thus, our code gets *dependent* on the **frameworks or libraries** used. Thus, they are called **dependencies**.

## Package Manager
Numerous frameworks and libraries are built on top of others and thus, they are **dependent** on other frameworks and libraries. Thus, those are also **dependencies** of the original code and must be included in the code.

To simplify it, **package-managers** download all the dependencies associated with a single dependency and the correct version of them as well.
