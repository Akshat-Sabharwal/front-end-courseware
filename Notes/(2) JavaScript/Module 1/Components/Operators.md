They are symbols (not [[Data Types#Symbol|these]] ones) that tell the computer, what to do with the mentioned objects.

#### Arithmetic Operators
Operators used with numbers.
The answers to all the examples below will be 8.

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|--|--|--|
| + | Addition | 7 + 1 |
| - | Subtraction | 14 - 6 |
| * | Multiplication | 2 * 4 |
| / | Division | 32 / 4 |
| % | Modulus (returns the remainder on division) | 18 % 10 |
| ** | Exponential | 2 ** 3 |

#### Comparison Operators
To compare objects and get a Boolean value. All the examples are true below.

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|--|--|--|
| > | Greater than | 5 > 2 |
| < | Less than | 3 < 7 |
| == | Checks if the LHS value is equal to RHS value | 9 == 9 |
| === | Checks for the equality of value **and** data type | 16 === 16 |
| != | Checks for unequal value | 8 != 4 |
| !== | Checks for unequal value **or** data type | 1 !== "1" |


>[!Note]
>In the example of  the **equality operator** `==` , the LHS is a **number** while the RHS is a **string**. 
>Since, the value of LHS and RHS is equal, the statement is true but not in the case of **strict equality operator** `===`.

#### Logical Operators
To logically analyze a given statement and get a Boolean value. All the examples are true below.

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|--|--|--|
| && (and) | Checks if both the statements are True | 5 < 8 && 4 > 2 |
| \|\| (or) | Checks if either of the statements is True | 5 < 8 \|\| 4 > 2 |
| ! (not) | Returns for the logical inverse of the statement | !(2 > 3) |
