*poly* means "many" and *morph* means "form". **Polymorphism** means taking multiple forms. In OOP, often the same method or object can output different results.

### Example
Herein, the `+` operator is used in both the situations, similarly. But, the output is different. 
The first one yields the string `"Pineapple"` and the second one, the number `7`. 

```js
// Using '+' with strings
console.log("Pine" + "apple");

// Using '+' with numbers
console.log(3 + 4);
```
