There are broadly two types of Version Control Systems (VCS).

### Centralized
Centralized Version Control System, or **CVCS** for short, is a **Client-Server framework**. 

All the files and their **versions** are stored on the server. The client, then, can access and update the files as and when required.

* The client first ***pulls*** or retrieves a file from the server.
* Any update, to be made, is made.
* The client then ***pushes*** or stores the newer version of the file on the server.

### Distributed
**DVCS** for short, it is essentially the same as **CVCS** but the difference is that it is a **Client-Client framework**. Here, the client acts as a server. So, all the data needs to be pulled once and pushing isn't required.
