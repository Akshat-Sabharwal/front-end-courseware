As mentioned [[CLI#^556277|earlier]], directory is just a folder. Using CLI, numerous other actions on such folders can be performed.

### List Contents
What the directory contains can be printed out in the **bash** using the `ls` command.
```shell
ls
```

##### Flags
* `-la` → Print out all the hidden files and folders, as well.
* `-l` → Print the contents in a list format.


### Current Working Directory
Or **cwd** for short, is the folder the user is in, currently. It can be printed using the `pwd` command.
```shell
pwd
```


### Move Directory
Placing the `directory_to_move` directory into the `target_directory` can be done using the `mv` command.
```shell
mv directory_to_move target_directory
```
