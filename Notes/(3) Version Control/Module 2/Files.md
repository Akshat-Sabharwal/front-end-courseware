Several actions can be performed on files via the CLI. 

### Printing Content
The contents of a file , `LICENSE.electron.txt` here, can be printed in the CLI using the command `cat`.
```bash
cat LICENSE.electron.txt
```

### Word Count
The total number of words in a file can, too, be printed in the CLI using `wc` along with the flag `-w`.
```shell
wc LICENSE.electron.txt -w
```
