Working with a Version Control System like Git revolves around what and how to access repositories.
### Remote
What cannot be accessed directly is **remote**. Similarly, a ***repo*** which cannot be accessed directly from the computer or machine is called a **remote repository**.
Every repository on GitHub is a remote *repo*.  
##### Creating a Remote Repo
Every *repo* **created** on GitHub is a remote one.

### Local
Every folder or *directory* and file on a computer is **local** to it. Thus, any repository on the computer itself, is called a **local repository**. 

##### Creating a Local Repo
Using the Git command, `init`, a **local *repo*** can be *initialized* or created.
```shell
%% Changing to the directory where the repository is to be created %%
cd repofolder

%% Initializing a Git repo %%
git init
```
