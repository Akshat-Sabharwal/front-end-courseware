After creating a [[Accessibility#Remote|remote repository]], assume you have to make changes to it.

To do this, 

* A *pipeline* or connection must be created which would join the computer and GitHub server.
* Then, the remote *repo* must be brought onto the **local** computer, via the *pipeline*.
* From the computer, the changes made can be pushed into the *pipeline*.
* These changes would be travel across the *pipeline* to GitHub where they would be made.

This *pipeline* is called a **remote**.
