The next step to change a remote *repo* is to ***clone*** or download the remote repository onto the computer to make changes to it.

This can be done using the Git command `clone`.
```shell
git clone url_of_the_repo
```

### Example
Cloning the repo `OpenTech`,
```shell
%% Changing Directory to opentech-repo %%
cd opentech-repo

git clone https://www.github.com/SomeOrg/OpenTech
```
