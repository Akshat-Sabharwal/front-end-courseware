Rendering 2D and 3D graphics in HTML is made possible by canvas which works in the same way as a real one.

### Tag
An HTML canvas can be added using the tag `<canvas></canvas>`. It has the attributes `height` and `width` to set its dimensions.

Graphics are rendered in a Canvas using CSS and JavaScript to add interactivity and logic to the animations or even games.
