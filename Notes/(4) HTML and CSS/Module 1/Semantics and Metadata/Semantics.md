 In a webpage, the function of a button cannot be known if it isn't labelled. 
![[Pasted image 20231028135309.png|200]]
In such an Authentication form, how would the user know which button is to *Sign In* and which to *Sign Up*? 

By simply using a label for each button.

Here, the label acts as a ***sematic***. The term ***semantic*** means *meaningfulness* or *how meaningful something is*.
