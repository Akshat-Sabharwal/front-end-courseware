**Motion Graphics** simply mean * **graphics**, which can be anything like a square or a cube, **that are in motion**  *i.e.*  ***moving objects***. 

### Approach
Animation is basically showing the changes done to a component, slowly, as a process and not an **instantaneous change**. It, using CSS, can be done in broadly two ways.


##### [[Transform and Transition]]
The first way is to define the change, initially, and execute it over a span of time.  

##### [[Keyframe Animation]]
The second method is to define the what changes are to occur step-wise.
This would make it seem natural and ***in motion***.
