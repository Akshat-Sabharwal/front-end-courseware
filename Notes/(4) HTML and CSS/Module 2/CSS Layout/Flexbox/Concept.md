**Flexbox** stands for **Flexible Box Model**. It is not actual HTML element. Rather a ***responsive*** CSS component. 

What makes it responsive is not the component itself but the properties it has.
>[!info]
>**Responsive** means *something which reacts or **responds** to an action*. 
>
>In CSS, how **responsive** a component is depends on how it can adjust itself according to the screen-size and other components.

The properties, underlisted, are mainly of two types.
