There are numerous units for the dimensions of the components in CSS which can broadly be categorized in two.

* ### Absolute Units
As the name suggests, it's value does not depend on anything. It is **fixed**.

| Unit | What it means |
|--|--|
| `px` | $1/96$ of an inch or about $0.026 cm$ |
| `cm` | $1 cm$ |

<br>

* ### Relative Units
These units change according to other factors or are **relative**.

| Unit | What it means |
|--|--|
| `vw` | $1\%$ of the viewport width |
| `vh` | $1\%$ of the viewport height |
| `em` | When set to a parent element, all the children components  will have the same value|
| `rem` | When set to a child element, it will have the specified value no matter what the parent font-size is |
