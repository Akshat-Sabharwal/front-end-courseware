*Pseudo* means *something that is not actually what it is meant to be* or simply, *fake or unreal*.

Thereby, ***Pseudo-components*** are not actual HTML or CSS components but a part or state of them. 

* ### [[Pseudo-Elements]]
<br>

  These are not actual HTML elements, rather, their parts. For instance, the first line of a paragraph. 

  **Pseudo-**,  because a part of an element is not an element in itself.

* ### [[Pseudo-Classes]]
<br>

  Similarly, they are not actual classes. They are ***the states the elements are in***. For instance, a button being clicked is still a button, but in a different state. 

   They are used to indicate **user action**. If such a pseudo-class wasn't used on the button, how would the user know if the button got pressed or not?
