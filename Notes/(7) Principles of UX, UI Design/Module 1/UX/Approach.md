Creating a UX design that stands all the quality and feedback tests involves a specific procedure with multiple steps.

### Empathize
*Empathize* itself means *to share feelings*. This is exactly what’s done. The **target audience** is interviewed to get to know of what problems they deal with in context of the product to build.

>[!info]
>**Target audience** means *potential customers*, *the people who are to fit to use your product*.
>For instance, the **target audience** of a *Fitness app* would be individuals who are physically unfit.


For instance, to build a food delivery app, the elderly and working people’s group must be interviewed.

### Define
With the given experience and problems faced by the target audience, the problems and their possible solutions need to be created.

For instance, if an elderly man states that *he is not able to **see** the buttons, clearly*, that’s a point to be noted. 

Here,
* **Problem** → Buttons appear small
* **Solution** → Make them bigger
<br>

### Ideate
With the problem and solution, in hand, the process of **ideating** or *coming up with unique ways of implementing the solution* must be initiated. 

*Getting ideas* is not a concrete process. It happens, instantaneously, some times and doesn’t for months, the other. 

Also, there is no perfect idea. So, waiting for *that perfect one* isn’t efficient. The only perfect way is to implement the idea and see for it.

### Prototype
The next step is to create a **prototype** of the product which, essentially is *a sample product works in the same way as expected*. 

If the prototype fails to work as expected, 
* Note down the failure points
* Re-work on the idea
* Create another prototype

If the overall implementation doesn’t feel as it should, a good approach would be to jump back to the ideation process.

### Test
Just like programming tests, the products must be tested by a group of random individuals to get their feedback on the UX. This is also called **User Research**.

The feedback can then be used to improve the product by **prototyping** or **ideating**.

### Build
Finally, build the product and launch it. That’s it.
