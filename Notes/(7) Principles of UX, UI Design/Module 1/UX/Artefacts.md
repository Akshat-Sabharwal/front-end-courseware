Many components are used to guide a new user through a product with a sense of familiarity. Some of them are understated.

### User Personas
These are mascot-like characters which resemble an individual from the target audience. 

For instance, in a *Mathematical* app, the user persona might be either of,
* **Mathematician** → To make the users think, that they, too, can become one.
* **Student** → To give a sense of familiarity to the students.

### Story Board
A storyboard is like a comic-book. It conveys the **objective** of the product in the form of a graphical story.

Say, for instance, a **scenario** for a *Cooking* app can be created as follows.

>[!example]
>Kayla is a great cook. Spices just flow through her hands. The veggies bloom when about to be cooked by her. But one dish that Kayla cannot have her hands over, is the humble **pie**.  
>
>She, then, uses the app, *Cooking*, to bake the **pie** using the recipe crafted by MasterChefs.
