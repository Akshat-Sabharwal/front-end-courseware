It, simply put, refers to *how convenient it is to work with a product* or *how **usable** it is*. It **cannot** be measured concretely but developers can get an idea of its state on the basis of UX.

Usability has five pillars.

### Learnability
How easy it is for the customers to **learn** to use the product determine the product’s **learnability** factor.

A food delivery app, that has an easy-to-understand process of ordering food will be considered to have good **learnability**.

### Efficiency
It highlights how **efficient** it is to make any changes in a product. 
Say, the items added in the cart need to be deleted or changed, an **efficient** app would require the least number of steps to do so.
<br>

### Memorability
It focuses on how well the user gets familiar with the product in the least amount of time. 
To change the password of the user account in such a product, the user must not be wandering in the app. It must be **accessible**
<br>

### Errors
If a user commits an error, how much effort must be put in to correct it and how well the product handles it, decides how good of an *error-handler* the product is.

If, for instance, during the payment process, the transaction fails, a good error-handling product would let the user know of the possible causes of the error.
<br>

### Satisfaction
A major chunk of the user’s experience depends on how the user *felt* after using the product. 
A *satisfying* product, not ASMR, would not make the user feel troubled or confused.
