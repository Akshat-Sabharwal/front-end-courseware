As the name suggests, **User-centered Design** is a *design prepared by keeping in mind the needs and persona of the target audience*.

The user is the customer, here, who will use the product only if it fits the need of the user, well. Thus, designing must be according to their persona.

For this purpose, two of the most utilitarian methods to create such designs are as follows.

### Interview
**Testing**, **User Research** and many more names but the core process remains **almost** the same. Interviewing the target audience before and after using the product is a good way to know the difference. 

For this, testing is used which is very important for improvement.

### Observation
Letting the users test the product is one part but **observing** their usage patterns and their reactions is another. One way of recording usersâ€™ review is using a [[Customer Journey Map]].

This map is then analyzed and necessary actions are taken which could improve the product.
