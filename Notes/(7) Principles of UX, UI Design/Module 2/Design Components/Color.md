Color represents mood. It has the power to create a specific aesthetic just be changing one of the colors, slightly. 

### Variations
Colors can and, in fact, **need** to be tweaked on the certain parameters.

* ##### Hue
It, basically, means *how much of **red**, **green** and **blue** is in the specified color*. Say, for instance, a color denoted by the RGB format, $(100, 50, 50)$, would mean that the *hue is about 0 degrees*. 

  Hue is measured in `deg` because each color is at a certain point in the [[Text#HSL|color wheel]]. 
  <br><br>
* ##### Saturation
It is *the amount of color added in the given color*. Imagine having a white canvas and some red-colored paint. If the paint is diluted in some water, its * **saturation** would decrease*.
<br><br>
* ##### Tint
It is, itself, a color, just that the specified color is mixed with some white to produce a **lighter shade** of the color.
<br><br>

* ##### Tone
Same as **tint**, the difference being that a color is mixed with **grey**.
<br><br>
* ##### Shade
Yet again, same as **tint**, the difference being that the color is mixed with **black**.
