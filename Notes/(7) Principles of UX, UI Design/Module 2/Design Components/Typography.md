Typography defines *the **how** * of text. It can attract a user to a piece of text and be the only caveat of a webpage, all depending upon *how it is stylized*.

Surprisingly enough, typography has numerous details, even for a single letter! Though, these cannot be varied, there are numerous fonts available to use with different presets. 

These are called **typography elements**.
