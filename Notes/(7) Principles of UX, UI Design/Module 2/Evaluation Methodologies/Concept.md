**Evaluation Methodology** is a fancy term for *a framework to evaluate a design*, *i.e.* *how good the design is, on some basis*.

There are multiple such *frameworks* or rather *guidelines* to follow, not mandatorily, but beneficially. These guidelines have some basic notions which when followed make a design *good*.

Some of them are,
* #### [[Ram’s Principles]] 
<br>
* #### [[Schneidermann’s Golden Rules]]
<br>
* #### [[Nielsen’s Heuristics]]
