*Heuristic* itself means *aiding in learning*. These are 10 such principles derived by Jakob Nielsen.

* #### Visibility of system status
The product should have the  current status or all the information required by the user, in an accessible location.
<br><br>
* #### Match between the system and real world
Allow the users to make connection between their past experiences and the new product by adding in some features which are, probably, accessed by the target audience.
<br><br>
* #### User control and freedom
Hand over the control and freedom to the user to use the product as wished.
<br><br>
* #### Consistency and standards
A component should be the same on one page as on another page. 
<br><br>
* #### Error prevention
Prevent any errors as much as possible by giving feedback to users at various stages.
<br><br>
* #### Recognition rather than recall
The product should not expect the user to make efforts by recalling information. Instead, make the user recognize the information.
<br><br>
* #### Flexibility and efficiency of use
Any new user can and should use it as an experienced user.
<br><br>
* #### Aesthetic and minimalistic design
The design must not have loads of components which might hide the utility.
<br><br>
* #### Error handling
Allow for easy error-resolution.
<br><br>
* #### Help documentation
The product should have a *how-to* documentation for a new user to get started with the product.
