These are 10 principles derived by Dieter Ram which when adopted make a *good design*.

* #### Good Design is innovative
A design should neither be copied nor be repeated. It must have a unique identity.
<br><br>

* #### Good Design makes a product useful
Just focusing on the overall look of a product won’t be enough. If possible, the design should also add in some utility to the product.
<br><br>

* #### Good Design is aesthetic
It makes the user feel comfortable and familiar.
<br><br>

* #### Good Design is understandable
The components of the design must be simple enough for a new user to get a hang of it.
<br><br>

* #### Good Design is unobtrusive
Making a design *extravagant* by tossing in loads of features which have no utility isn’t a good practice.
<br><br>
* #### Good Design is thorough
Despite being simple, the components should have the finesse which would make the product consistent.
<br><br>

* #### Good Design is long-lasting
Simply put, an evergreen design. A design that is not short-lived. A design that, even if not updated, lasts for considerable time. 
<br><br>

* #### Good Design is honest
It is what it looks like. No fixings or tricks with the user.
<br><br>

* #### Good Design is as little as possible
It is **not** exactly **minimalism** but an adaptation of it. Make the design such that it makes sense all together.
<br><br>

* #### Good Design is environment-friendly
Design isn’t limited to the digital screen. It should not harm the environment just for good-looks or good-utility.
