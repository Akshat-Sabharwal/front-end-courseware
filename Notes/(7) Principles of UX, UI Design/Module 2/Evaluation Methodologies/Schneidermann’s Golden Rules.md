These are 8 golden rules derived by Ben Schneidermann which  makes a design well-built.

* #### Strive for consistency
The design should create its identity in the user’s mind.
<br><br>
* #### Allow for shortcuts
Let the users traverse the complete product in the least number of actions.
<br><br>
* #### Offer feedback
Let the users know where how they performed and can better use the product.
<br><br>
* #### Design dialog to yield closure
Each interaction with the product should be indicated with a start and an end, so that the users can know where they are.
<br><br>
* #### Offer simple error handling
Allowing the users to simply solve errors makes them feel *backed*.
<br><br>
* #### Permit easy reversal of actions
The user should be able to undo the actions for convenience.
<br><br>
* #### Support internal locus of control
Make the user feel as if they are in control of the product by not interrupting or initiating an action without user’s permission.
<br><br>
* #### Reduce short-term memory load
Let the user select and use the product without much effort. Such a design should not let the user **remember** the information, instead **recognize** the information.
