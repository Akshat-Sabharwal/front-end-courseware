*Bi-* means **two**. Thus, *binary* means **consisting of two parts**.


### Number System
As the name suggests, it is a system of numbers, *i.e.* *a way of writing numbers, mathematically*. There are numerous number systems *depending on the numbers they use*.

##### Base 10
Generally, to count and calculate, the **Base 10** number system is used which basically means, ***a system containing 10 different numbers***. 

**Base 10** because there can be 10 different remainders for any number divided by 10. 
For instance, 
* $18/10$ → remainder of 8
* $19/10$ → remainder of 9
* $20/10$ → remainder of 0
* $21/10$ → remainder of 1
* $22/10$ → remainder of 2

The remainders can range from 0 to 9 which are 10 different numbers. Also, *any number can be formed **using these remainders** and **powers of 10** *.

For instance, 
* $18 = 10 + 8 = 1*10^1 + 8*10^0$
* $221 = 200 + 20 + 1 = 2*10^2 + 2*10^1 + 1*10^0$

The general breakdown looks like, $num = remainder * 10 ^ p$.
> [!note]
> The numbers that are multiplied with the powers of 10 are, actually, the digits of the number.
> 
> For instance, here, $403 = 4*10^2 + 0*10^1 + 3*10^0$, the numbers are 4, 0 and 3 which form the number 403. 
> 
> This is stated as, *the number 403 is 403 in base 10* or *the base 10 representation of 403 is 403*.

##### Base 2
Also called **binary**, just like Base 10, it also is a number system involving 2 different numbers, 1 and 0.

With the same reasoning as Base 10, on dividing any number by 2, the possible remainders are 0 and 1. Thus, any number can be formed **using the remainders** and **powers of 2**.

For instance, 
* $32 = 0*2^0 + 0*2^1 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^3 + 0*2^4 + 1*2^5$
* $87 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 16 + 64 = 1*2^0 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^2 + 0*2^3 + 1*2^4 + 0*2^5 + 1*2^6$
* $5 = 1 + 4 = 1*2^0 + 1*2^1$

Thus, 
* $32$ → $000001$
* $87$ → $1110101$
* $5$ → $11$
