A computer mainly has three types of memory, 
* Cache 
* Main
* Secondary

### Cache Memory
It is the most *expensive* type of memory, meaning that *it takes the most time to process*. 

Whenever any task is to be performed, 
* The computer checks for the requirements in the cache memory. If present, the task is executed

* Else, the computer checks for the requirements in the **main memory**. If present, they are brought into the cache memory and the task is executed.

### Main Memory
It is where most of the data that, when not needed, is stored. It has two parts,
* **RAM** → Random Access Memory
* **ROM** → Read-Only Memory

##### RAM
It is **volatile** in nature, meaning that, *if some data is stored in **RAM** and the power goes off, all the data will be lost*.

Thus, it is like a *temporary work area*. All the data required to process is first brought to RAM and then is it processed. 

##### ROM
It is **non-volatile** in nature, meaning that, *the data stored will remain stored in the ROM* . This is because it is a ***read-only*** memory, it cannot be modified.

### Secondary Memory
External memory devices, cloud storage and types alike are considered as **secondary memory**. When used, all the memory needs to be loaded in RAM which makes it slower.
