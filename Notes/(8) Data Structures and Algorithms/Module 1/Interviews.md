There are typically numerous interviews of a candidate prior to, actually, hiring. 

### Screening
This is the first interaction between the company and candidate. The introductory information such as,
* Suitability of the candidate for the role
* Programming languages used
* Work ethics of the company 

…and more is exchanged.

### Quiz
It is, essentially, a quiz for the candidate to test their knowledge and ability in the required field or tech stack.


### Online Coding Assignment
The candidate is given a programmatic task or problem to solve, efficiently. This is generally remote and is thus, non-pressurized.  


### Technical Interview
It is a coding challenge, much like in the online coding assignment. Generally, it is not much complex as **problem-solving skills** are major chunk of the interviewer’s judging criteria.


### Take-home Assignment
This stage is the closest to hiring. Herein, the candidate is given a larger project such as, *building a web app*, which is to be done over a larger span of time, at home.
