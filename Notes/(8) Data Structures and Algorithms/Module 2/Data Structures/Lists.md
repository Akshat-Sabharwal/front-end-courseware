It is the simplest data structure which, simply, stores data in **sequential order**. It has the following characteristics,

* **Mutability** → It is a **mutable** structure, meaning the data can be changed, after creation
* **Ordered** → It retains its order, *i.e.* an element added at the end remains at the end
* **Dynamic** → It increases in size as per the data stored inside it

### Example
In JavaScript, a list is basically an array. 
```js
let list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```
