It is a collection data structure similar to [[Lists|lists]]. The difference being, 

* **Mutability** → It is **immutable** meaning that data once entered cannot be changed
* **Order** → It is **unordered**. Thus, the first element added to the set might not be the first, anymore.
* **Duplication** → It doesn’t allow for duplicate elements

### Implementation
A set can be created using a list or, simply, by using the in-built **set** data structure.

In JavaScript, a set can be created using the *curly-braces* `{}`.
```js
let set = {2, 4, 6};
```
